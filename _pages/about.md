Welcome! My name is Joel Wolfrath; I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Science and Engineering department at the Univerity of Minnesota. I also earned my MS in Statistics at Texas A&M University in 2018. My research focuses on the impact of non-IID data in distributed analytics systems. I'm also investigating methods for exploiting this data heterogeneity to make systems more efficient.
