Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Science and Engineering department at the Univerity of Minnesota. I've also earned my MS in Statistics at Texas A&M University in 2018. My research focuses on the impact of non-IID data in distributed analytics systems. I also propose ways in which these properties can be exploited to make systems more efficient.
